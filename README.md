## About
Work in progress web-application focused on helping Monster Hunter: World players create and share armor builds.

### Why?
Ever since I started playing Monster Hunter back in 2013, I was always searching for a useful, yet user-friendly, tool that could help me build sets for my character in-game. There are the ever-useful kiranico resources, wiki's and Athena's Assistant, but nothing I used felt intuitive or was easy to access.

Searching for builds online was a struggle, too. I always had to extrapolate what someone was using in a video, or crawl through forum or community posts looking for builds that always differed in formats.

### Enter Felyne Fitters
Now that Monster Hunter is a globally recognized cross-platform game, I couldn't help but wonder how many other people felt the same way I do about theorying their characters loadouts and making them accessible. This application aims to help those players by providing an intuitive and helpful interface that they could interact with to create and share armor builds.
